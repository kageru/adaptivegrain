# Haswell was the first generation to have FMA instructions, which this plugin makes heavy use of. Thereâ€™s about a 20% speedup from this.
# I doubt anyone still encodes on hardware older than that, and if they do, I trust they can figure out how to build their own binaries.
# --emit=asm forces rustc to compile the crate with only one thread, which can help the optimizer (1-2% faster on my machine)
